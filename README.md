# 🧠 TabbyAI  
### An Intelligent Agent for Reducing Digital Resource Waste

---

## 🌍 Overview

Every day, millions of users accumulate browser tabs they no longer use.

While these tabs appear harmless, they represent a form of **invisible digital waste**:

- Background CPU wakeups  
- Memory pressure  
- Network polling  
- CDN processing  
- Server compute cycles  
- Battery drain  
- Cognitive overload  

Modern browsers include features like “Sleeping Tabs” or “Memory Saver.” However, these systems focus on **machine optimization**, not **waste elimination or behavioral awareness**.

Sleeping a tab is not the same as eliminating abandoned digital activity.

**TabZero identifies, measures, and eliminates unused tabs in a measurable, explainable, and reversible way.**

---

# 🎯 Our Mission

To reduce **computational, distributed infrastructure, and attention waste** caused by abandoned browser tabs.

We target three layers of waste:

1. **Computational Waste** (CPU, memory, battery)
2. **Distributed Infrastructure Waste** (CDNs, servers, cooling systems)
3. **Human Attention Waste** (cognitive overload and clutter)

---

# 🔬 Research & Background

## 📊 Tab Accumulation Is Common

Recent survey data (Bitkom Research, 2025) shows:

- 65% of users keep 2–10 tabs open  
- 10% keep 11–20 tabs open  
- 4% keep 21–50 tabs open  
- A small percentage keep 50+ tabs open  

Tab overload is widespread.

---

## 💻 Browsers Confirm Tabs Consume Resources

Microsoft Edge reports that sleeping tabs save approximately:

- **85% memory**
- **99% CPU usage**

Google Chrome introduced Memory Saver and Energy Saver because background tabs consume measurable memory, CPU, and battery resources.

Inactive tabs are not inert.

---

## 🌐 Distributed Infrastructure Impact

Even unused tabs may:

- Run JavaScript timers  
- Poll APIs  
- Maintain WebSocket connections  
- Refresh advertisements  
- Send analytics pings  

Each request:

1. Travels through network infrastructure  
2. Hits CDN edge servers  
3. May reach origin servers  
4. Triggers logging and storage operations  

At scale, small background activity multiplies into:

- CDN CPU cycles  
- Data center cooling demand  
- Database I/O  
- Network routing energy  

Closing abandoned tabs eliminates this chain at the source.

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Load & Attention Waste

Open tabs represent:

- Task switching cost  
- Decision fatigue  
- Context fragmentation  
- Unresolved mental loops  

Cognitive Load Theory shows working memory is limited.

Sleeping tabs reduce machine load.
They do not reduce visible clutter or behavioral waste.

TabZero treats **attention as a finite resource.**

---

# 🚀 Our Solution

TabZero is an intelligent browser agent that:

1. Detects unused tabs using measurable thresholds
2. Applies safety rules (never closes active, pinned, or protected tabs)
3. Eliminates abandoned tabs entirely
4. Groups closed tabs semantically
5. Generates human-readable summaries
6. Allows full restoration

We do not merely suspend tabs.
We eliminate digital waste intentionally.

---

# ⚙️ How It Works

## Step 1 — Detection

A tab is considered unused if:

- It is not active
- It is not pinned
- It is not audible
- It is not in protected domains
- It has not been accessed for X minutes

This creates a measurable operational definition of digital waste.

---

## Step 2 — Elimination

Instead of sleeping tabs, we:

- Close them permanently  
- Remove background execution  
- Eliminate future wakeups  
- Prevent reactivation spikes  

This reduces:

- CPU wakeups  
- Memory allocation  
- Network polling  
- Distributed compute overhead  

---

## Step 3 — Intelligence Layer

After cleanup, we:

- Group tabs by domain and topic  
- Generate a summary of removed tabs  
- Provide behavioral insight  

Example:

> Closed 19 unused tabs (idle > 3 hours).  
> 7 were shopping-related.  
> 5 were documentation references.  
> 4 were social media tabs.  

This transforms invisible clutter into measurable awareness.

# 📈 Measurable Waste Reduction

## 1️⃣ Tab Clutter Reduction

Before cleanup:
- Total tabs
- % unused

After cleanup:
- Reduced tab count
- Unused tabs eliminated

---

## 2️⃣ Memory Impact

Measured via browser task manager:
- Memory footprint before
- Memory footprint after

---

## 3️⃣ CPU / Energy Impact

Measured via OS tools:
- Energy impact before
- Energy impact after

---

## 4️⃣ Distributed Activity Elimination

Closing tabs eliminates:

- Background API polling  
- Ad refresh cycles  
- Analytics heartbeats  
- CDN request handling  

Sleeping tabs reduce CPU.
Closing tabs eliminates the source.

---

# 🔥 Why This Is Necessary (Despite Memory Saver)

Chrome optimizes performance.

TabZero optimizes waste elimination and awareness.

Chrome:
- Suspends inactive tabs
- Reduces CPU temporarily
- Keeps clutter visible

TabZero:
- Identifies abandonment
- Eliminates clutter
- Prevents reactivation
- Measures behavioral waste
- Makes cleanup explainable and reversible

This shifts the focus from performance optimization to **digital resource accountability.**

---

# 🌱 Environmental Perspective

Unused digital activity propagates through:

1. Device CPU  
2. Network infrastructure  
3. CDN edge servers  
4. Origin servers  
5. Database systems  
6. Data center cooling  
7. Hardware manufacturing (long-term scaling)  

By eliminating abandoned tabs at the user level, we interrupt unnecessary distributed compute activity at the source.

We do not overclaim global carbon savings.
We focus on measurable, scalable reduction.

# 🧠 Final Statement

Digital waste is invisible.

Open tabs seem harmless, but they:

- Consume compute resources  
- Trigger distributed infrastructure activity  
- Drain battery  
- Fragment attention  

TabZero transforms passive browser clutter into measurable, reducible waste.

We do not just optimize machines.

We optimize digital behavior.
